            <h2>What is Carne Asda</h2>
                <p>Carne asada is grilled and sliced beef, usually skirt steak, or a flank steak. It is usually marinated then grilled or seared to impart a charred flavor. Carne asada can be served 
                   on its own or as an ingredient in other dishes.<br><br>If you're looking for an authentic Carne Asada recipe - this is it! Grilled Carne Asada 
                   tastes better and looks more beautiful than it has a right to, if you judge a meal by the amount of effort it takes. And it's a sensory pleasure before it even touches the grill! 
                   As you squeeze fresh orange, lime and lemon juices for the marinade, then whisk in cilantro, garlic and jalapeño, the aroma that floats up to your nose is nothing short of heavenly.
