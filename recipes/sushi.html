                    <li>1 avocado, thinly sliced</li>
                </ui>   
        <h3>Now lets put it all together</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Season the sushi rice with the rice vinegar,fanning and stirring 
                until room temperature.
                       </li><br>
                    <li>On a rolling mat, place one sheet of nori with the
                rough side facing upwards.
                       </li><br>
                    <li>Wet your hands and grab a handful of rice and place it on the nori. Spread
                the rice evenly throughout the nori without mashing the rice down.
                Season rice with  a pinch of sesame seeds, if using, then flip it over
                so the nori is facing upwards.
                       </li><br>
                    <li>Arrange, in a horizontal row 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom, the crab followed by
                a row of avocado and a row of cucumber.
                       </li><br>
                    <li>Grabbing both nori and the mat, roll the mat over the filling so the extra space 
                at the bottom touches the other side, squeezing down to make a nice tight roll. Squeeze down along 
                the way to keep the roll from holding its shape.
                       </li><br>
                    <li>Transfer the roll onto a cutting board. Rub a knife on a damp paper\
             towel before slicing the roll into six equal portions.
                       </li><br>
                    <li>Enjoy!</li>
